What this code does is as follows;
Every second, an imaginary dice will be rolled for each application, all with set chances.
If the roll is successful, the application will open. If the roll is unsucessfull, nothing will happen.


Explaining ("c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro\Balatro.exe", 50)

The directory ("c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro\Balatro.exe") is where your application is located.
The number ("50") After the directory is your chance, this means that every second this code is running, it has a 1/50 chance to open said application.


This code is free to use for content, streaming, or just for fun.
